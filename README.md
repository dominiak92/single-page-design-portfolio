## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

### Links

- Live Site URL: [LIVE SITE](https://dominiak92.github.io/single-page-design-portfolio/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned that grid work can be fun, too. I saw how SCSS and BEM can make work very easy. 
I'm happy with how I used SCSS to create breakpoints and buttons, as well as it came in handy when creating tiles. I used the swiper library because it fit the design of the site much better than what the author of the mockup suggested.
